# FundAnalyser
Uses yahoo price data to generate simple reports 
I use it to keep an eye on my investments as a passive long term investor

Add funds in FundList (ISIN used to ask Yahoo) - the units can be passed to analyse actual position value
Add additional analysers in FundDataAnalysers and then add these as indicators in the Fund - these indicators will be published to the report
The report contains the indicators and a warnings tab populated based on acceptable global values (e.g. max vol, max loss etc)
See sample report in Data/Reports

Please feel free to update with a PR
